# Movie-Recommendation
The largest movie libraries in the world are all digitized and transferred to online streaming services, like Netflix. Enhanced with AI-powered tools, these platforms can now assist us with probably the most difficult chore of all  picking a movie.

# Filtration Strategies for Movie Recommendation Systems
Movie recommendation systems use a set of different filtration strategies and algorithms to help users find the most relevant films. The most popular categories of the ML algorithms used for movie recommendations include content-based filtering and collaborative filtering systems.

# Content-Based Filtering
A filtration strategy for movie recommendation systems, which uses the data provided about the items (movies). This data plays a crucial role here and is extracted from only one user. An ML algorithm used for this strategy recommends motion pictures that are similar to the user’s preferences in the past. Therefore, the similarity in content-based filtering is generated by the data about the past film selections and likes by only one user.

How does it work? The recommendation system analyzes the past preferences of the user concerned, and then it uses this information to try to find similar movies. This information is available in the database (e.g., lead actors, director, genre, etc.). After that, the system provides movie recommendations for the user. That said, the core element in content-based filtering is only the data of only one user that is used to make predictions.

# Collaborative Filtering
As the name suggests, this filtering strategy is based on the combination of the relevant user’s and other users’ behaviors. The system compares and contrasts these behaviors for the most optimal results. It’s a collaboration of the multiple users’ film preferences and behaviors.

What’s the mechanism behind this strategy? The core element in this movie recommendation system and the ML algorithm it’s built on is the history of all users in the database. Basically, collaborative filtering is based on the interaction of all users in the system with the items (movies). Thus, every user impacts the final outcome of this ML-based recommendation system, while content-based filtering depends strictly on the data from one user for its modeling.

Collaborative filtering algorithms are divided into two categories:

#User-based collaborative filtering: 
The idea is to look for similar patterns in movie preferences in the target user and other users in the database.

#Item-based collaborative filtering:
The basic concept here is to look for similar items (movies) that target users rate or interact with.
